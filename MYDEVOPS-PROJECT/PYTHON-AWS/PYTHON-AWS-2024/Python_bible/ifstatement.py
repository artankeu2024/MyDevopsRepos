False and True = False

combining "not" and "and"

if not (c > 10 and d > 1):
    print(it worked)

true or false = true
false or false = false

combining "not" and "or"

C = 6
D = 2
if (C> 5 and D> 5)  or ( C> 1 and D > 1):
    print ("it worked")
this is true so it will print it 

if not ((C> 5 and D> 5)  or ( C> 1 and D > 1)):
    print ("it worked")
this will not work because the result is false with the not operator
