tuple is like a list but its immutable it can't be change

tuple are iterable like string and list . they support sequence(storing using position/index) and not mapping(storing using key and value)but different 
from dictionnarie as its immutable. you can reassign the value of an items using indexing . 

tuple = 1,2,3,"A""B","C"
tuple = (1,2,3,"A""B","C")

when using loop you can leverage a tupple unpacking to have a single item when printing
